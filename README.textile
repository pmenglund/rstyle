Implements checks for some of the "Ruby":https://github.com/chneukirchen/styleguide/blob/master/RUBY-STYLE style guide items.

This tool is meant to be use as a pre-commit hook for <code>git</code>, to ensure the code is properly formatted. Run the following
<pre>
cd .git/hooks
ln -s /path/to/bin/rstyle
</pre>

and you'll have to be compliant with the <code>rstyle</code> checks to be able to commit code to the repository.

It can also be used to check one or more ruby files in standalone mode:
<pre>
    rstyle /path/to/rubyfile.rb
</pre>

The style checker looks for the following:
* line longer than 80 characters
* empty line contains whitespace
* line contains tab(s)
* line ends with whitespace
* no space after ,
* space after ( and [ or before ) and ]
* methods should be in snake_case
* use two spaces before statement modifiers

It will also issue warnings for the following:
* don't use <code>for/code> unless you know what you are doing
